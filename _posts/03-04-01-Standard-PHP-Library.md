## Librería Estandar de PHP {#libreria_estandar_de_php_title}

The Standard PHP Library (SPL) is packaged with PHP and provides a collection of classes and interfaces. It is made up
primarily of commonly needed datastructure classes (stack, queue, heap, and so on), and iterators which can traverse
over these datastructures or your own classes which implement SPL interfaces.
